Raspberry Pi Temperature Probe

The code here is a modification of [this](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-11-ds18b20-temperature-sensing/overview) guide to work with influxdb.

Read about the process: [here](https://nathanielkaiser.xyz/treehousetemps.html)

When installing add your own influxdb server ip and token, as well as changing the bucket and project in the code.

You also need to enable 1-wire in sudo raspi-config
